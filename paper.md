  # Summary

  This is a proof of concept integration between a Wordpress blog and the Bodleian's First 
  Folio [@ff] to allow researchers using Web-based tools, such as Wordpress, to import and
  cite online texts without copying the data.

  Using a short code, the XML encoded text is transformed into a Harvard citation within
  the body of the article text. Our aim is to look at the re-use of data within the 
  Humanities using a popular tool.
